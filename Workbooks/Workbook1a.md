# **Command Line Basics**

- **What is the Command Line?**  
  The Command Line is a text-based interface where you type commands to interact with your computerâ€™s files and programs. It's especially useful for tasks like navigating through folders or running programs, which are faster than using graphical interfaces.

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  $ date   # Outputs the current date and time
  ```

- **Basic Commands**:

  - **pwd (print working directory)**: Shows where you are in the file system.

    ```bash
    $ pwd
    /Users/yourname/Documents
    ```

  - **ls (list)**: Lists the files and folders in your current directory.

    ```bash
    $ ls
    Documents  Downloads  Pictures
    ```

  - **cd (change directory)**: Move between directories.

    ```bash
    $ cd Documents
    ```

  - **mkdir (make directory)**: Create a new folder.

    ```bash
    $ mkdir new_folder
    ```

  - **touch**: Create a new, empty file.

    ```bash
    $ touch file.txt
    ```

  - **rm (remove)**: Delete files, and use `rmdir` to delete folders.
    ```bash
    $ rm file.txt
    $ rmdir empty_folder
    ```

### **File Paths**

- **Absolute Path**: Starts from the root directory (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Documents/file.txt`).
- **Relative Path**: Starts from your current location (e.g., `./file.txt`).

### **Git Basics**

Git is a version control system that helps track changes in your project over time. You can save "snapshots" of your code called **commits**, which lets you revert back to previous versions if needed.

#### **Key Git Concepts**:

1. **Working Directory**: Where your code resides.
2. **Staging Area**: Where files are prepared for a commit.
3. **Local Repository**: Where the actual commits are stored.

---

### **Basic Git Commands**

- **git init**: Initializes a new Git repository in your project folder. This command is run inside the folder you want Git to track.

  ```bash
  $ git init
  ```

- **git status**: Shows the current state of your project, including which files are modified, added, or removed, but not yet committed.

  ```bash
  $ git status
  ```

- **git add**: Prepares files for the next commit by adding them to the staging area.

  **Examples**:

  - Add a specific file:
    ```bash
    $ git add file.txt
    ```
  - Add all modified, deleted, or newly created files:

    ```bash
    $ git add .
    ```

    **Note:**  
    The `git add .` command stages **all files** (new, modified, and deleted) in the current directory and its subdirectories, preparing them for the next commit. This is useful when you've made multiple changes and want to add everything at once.

---

### **Committing Files**

Once your files are in the staging area, you commit them to the local repository, effectively saving the current state of your project.

- **git commit**: This command commits the staged files with a message describing the changes.
  ```bash
  $ git commit -m "Initial commit with basic project structure"
  ```

---

### **Branching in Git**

- **Branches** in Git allow you to work on different versions of your project at the same time. For example, you might have a `main` branch with stable code and a `feature` branch where you develop a new feature.

- **git branch**: Creates a new branch.

  ```bash
  $ git branch new-feature
  ```

- **git checkout**: Switches between branches.

  ```bash
  $ git checkout new-feature
  ```

- **git merge**: Merges a branch into your current branch (e.g., merging your `new-feature` branch into `main` once the feature is complete).
  ```bash
  $ git merge new-feature
  ```

---

### **Working with Remote Repositories (GitHub)**

Git also allows you to work with **remote repositories** like GitHub, where you can collaborate with others.

- **git clone**: Downloads a remote repository (e.g., from GitHub) to your local machine.

  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
  ```

- **git push**: Sends your committed changes from your local repository to a remote one.

  ```bash
  $ git push origin main
  ```

- **git pull**: Updates your local project with any changes that have been pushed to the remote repository.
  ```bash
  $ git pull origin main
  ```

---

### **Putting it All Together**

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:

   ```bash
   $ git init
   ```

2. **Check the status of your project**:

   ```bash
   $ git status
   ```

3. **Stage your files** (e.g., add all files using `git add .`):

   ```bash
   $ git add .
   ```

4. **Commit the staged files**:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "Added all project files"
   ```

5. **Create and switch to a new branch**:

   ```bash
   $ git branch new-feature
   $ git checkout new-feature
   ```

6. **Push your changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   $ git push origin new-feature
   ```
