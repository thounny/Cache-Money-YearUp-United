# Bash Command Line Basics for Beginners

This guide will introduce you to five essential Bash commands: `ls`, `echo`, `mkdir`, `mv`, and `cd`. By the end, you'll know how to create folders, files, check directories, move files, and navigate your system.

---

## 1. How to Create a Folder (Directory) - `mkdir`

The `mkdir` command creates a new folder.

### Command:
```bash
mkdir folder_name
```

### Example:
```bash
mkdir my_folder
```

This will create a folder called `my_folder` in your current directory.

---

## 2. How to Create a File - `echo`

The `echo` command can be used to create a file and add some initial content.

### Command:
```bash
echo "Your text here" > file_name
```

### Example:
```bash
echo "Hello, World!" > myfile.txt
```

This creates a file called `myfile.txt` with the text "Hello, World!" inside.

---

## 3. How to List Files and Folders in a Directory - `ls`

To see the contents of a directory, you can use the `ls` command.

### Command:
```bash
ls
```

### Example:
```bash
ls
```

You should see your `my_folder` and `myfile.txt` if you’ve created them.

---

## 4. How to Change Directories - `cd`

To navigate into a different directory, use the `cd` command.

### Command:
```bash
cd folder_name
```

### Example:
```bash
cd my_folder
```

This will move you into the folder `my_folder`.

To go back to the previous directory (the parent directory), use:
```bash
cd ..
```

---

## 5. How to Move Files - `mv`

To move a file from one location to another, use the `mv` command.

### Command:
```bash
mv file_name destination_folder/
```

### Example:
```bash
mv myfile.txt my_folder/
```

This moves `myfile.txt` into the folder `my_folder`.

You can also use `mv` to rename a file:
```bash
mv oldfile.txt newfile.txt
```

---

## 6. Viewing the Current Directory - `pwd`

If you want to see which directory you are currently in, use the `pwd` command:

### Command:
```bash
pwd
```

This will print the path of your current working directory.

## Example Workflow

Here’s a quick example workflow combining all these commands:

1. Create a folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir my_project
   ```

2. Move into that folder:
   ```bash
   cd my_project
   ```

3. Create a file with some content:
   ```bash
   echo "This is my first project." > project.txt
   ```

4. List the contents of the folder:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```

5. Move the file into a new folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir backup
   mv project.txt backup/
   ```

6. List the contents of the `backup` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backup
   ls
   ```
