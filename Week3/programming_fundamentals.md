# **Beginner's Guide to Programming Fundamentals**

## **1. Understanding the Basics: CPU, RAM, and DISK**

### **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- **What is it?**  
  The brain of the computer that processes instructions and performs calculations. It’s where all the logic happens.
- **Example:**  
  Think of it as a chef following a recipe step-by-step.

### **RAM (Random Access Memory)**
- **What is it?**  
  A form of temporary storage that the CPU uses to store data quickly while processing. Once the power is off, everything in RAM is cleared.
- **Example:**  
  It’s like a kitchen countertop where the chef places ingredients while cooking.

### **DISK (Hard Drive or SSD)**
- **What is it?**  
  Long-term storage for data, including files, applications, and the operating system.
- **Example:**  
  Think of it as the pantry where the chef stores ingredients for later use.

## **2. Machine Language vs. Assembly Language**

### **Machine Language**
- **What is it?**  
  The lowest-level language that the CPU directly understands. It’s written in binary (1s and 0s).

### **Assembly Language**
- **What is it?**  
  A low-level language that is one step above machine language. It uses human-readable mnemonics like `MOV` or `ADD`.

---

## **3. Instruction Set**
- **Definition:**  
  A collection of instructions that a CPU can execute (e.g., arithmetic, moving data).  
  **Data**: The information being processed (numbers, text).  
  **Code (Instructions)**: Commands that tell the CPU what to do with the data.

### **Assembly Language Example Code:**
```assembly
MOV A, 5  ; Move value 5 into register A
ADD A, B  ; Add value in register B to A
```

## **4. Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages**

### **Compiled Languages**  
- **Examples:** C, C#, Java, Rust  
- **What is it?**  
  These languages are converted into machine code before execution, making them fast.  
- **Example:**  
  Like translating an entire book into another language before reading it.

### **Interpreted Languages**  
- **Examples:** Python, JavaScript, PHP, Perl  
- **What is it?**  
  These languages are translated line-by-line as they run, making them easy to use but generally slower than compiled languages.  
- **Example:**  
  Like using a translator to translate one sentence at a time as you read.

## **5. JavaScript Overview**

### **JavaScript and HTML Work Together**
- **HTML** structures the webpage, while **JavaScript** makes it interactive.

### **JavaScript Can Run Outside the Browser**
- Using **Node.js**, JavaScript can run outside the browser, for testing and learning purposes in the terminal.
  
### **Output Locations:**
- **HTML/CSS** -> Outputs in the browser (e.g., Google Chrome).  
- **JavaScript** -> Outputs in the browser *or* terminal using Node.js.

### **JavaScript Reads Top to Bottom**
- JavaScript reads and executes code from top to bottom, interpreting it one line at a time.

## **6. Example Code Breakdown:**

```javascript
a = 3;  // Declaration and assignment: Assigns the value 3 to the variable a.
b = 5;  // Declaration and assignment: Assigns the value 5 to the variable b.
c = a + b;  // Expression: Adds a and b, then assigns the result (8) to variable c.
console.log(c);  // Logs the value of c (8) to the console.
// Output: 8
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Declaration and Assignment**  
   ```javascript
   a = 3;
   ```
   - **What is it?**  
     A variable `a` is declared and assigned the value `3`. It stores this value for later use.
  
2. **Variable Declaration and Assignment**  
   ```javascript
   b = 5;
   ```
   - **What is it?**  
     A variable `b` is declared and assigned the value `5`.

3. **Expression and Assignment**  
   ```javascript
   c = a + b;
   ```
   - **What is it?**  
     This line adds the values stored in `a` and `b` (3 + 5) and stores the result (`8`) in variable `c`.

4. **Logging Output to Console**  
   ```javascript
   console.log(c);
   ```
   - **What is it?**  
     This line passes the value of `c` into the `log()` function of the `console` object. The output `8` is displayed in the terminal or browser console.

## **7. Concatenation in JavaScript**

JavaScript allows us to "chain together" strings of text (or numbers) using the **concatenation operator** (`+`).

### **Code Example:**
```javascript
//F5 fn+5 RUN/PLAY

let firstName = "Kevin"; // JavaScript's fundamental/primitive data types
let greeting = "Hello";  // Include numbers and strings of characters/letters

// Concatenate operator = "chain together" like a train.
let message = greeting + firstName;

console.log(message); // Outputs: "HelloKevin"
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Primitive Data Types**
   - JavaScript supports basic types like **strings** (sequences of characters) and **numbers** (integers, floats).
   - In this example, `firstName` and `greeting` are both **string** variables.

   ```javascript
   let firstName = "Kevin";  // String variable
   let greeting = "Hello";   // Another string variable
   ```

2. **Concatenation Operator**  
   - The **`+` operator** can be used to combine (concatenate) strings into one continuous piece of text. 
   - The variable `message` combines the content of `greeting` ("Hello") and `firstName` ("Kevin") to create "HelloKevin".

   ```javascript
   let message = greeting + firstName;
   ```

3. **Logging Output to Console**
   - We use `console.log(message)` to print the value of `message` to the console, which in this case would output "HelloKevin".
   - If you want a space between the words, you can modify the concatenation as follows:

   ```javascript
   let message = greeting + " " + firstName;  // Adds a space between "Hello" and "Kevin"
   console.log(message);  // Outputs: "Hello Kevin"
   ```

### **F5 fn+5 RUN/PLAY**
- This line is a hint to use the keyboard shortcut **F5** or **fn+5** in some environments to **run/play** the JavaScript code if you're using an IDE or code editor.

## **8. Variables and Expressions**

### **Statements and Expressions**
- **Statements:**  
  A piece of code that performs an action.  
  Example:  
  ```javascript
  let x = 10;
  ```

- **Expressions:**  
  An expression is a combination of variables and operators that produces a value.  
  Example:  
  ```javascript
  a + b // This is an expression
  ```

### **Operators**
- **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
  Example:  
  ```javascript
  let sum = a + b;
  ```

- **Assignment Operator:** `=`  
  - This assigns the value of the expression on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.
  - Example:  
    ```javascript
    let c = a + b; // Assigns the value of a + b to c
    ```

## **9. Variables as Identifiers**

### **What Are Variables?**
- **Definition:**  
  Variables are containers that hold values or data. In JavaScript, you can think of them like labeled boxes.

### **Concepts of Identifiers and Values**
- **Identifiers:**  
  The names given to variables (e.g., `a`, `b`, `c`) are called identifiers.  
  Example:  
  ```javascript
  let firstName = "Thounny";
  ```

- **Values:**  
  Variables hold values. In the example above, `firstName` holds the value `"Thounny"`.
  
### **Everyday Analogy:**  
- Think of variables as columns in an Excel spreadsheet, where each column holds specific data.

## **10. Console and Logging**

### **`console.log()`**
- **What is it?**  
  The `console.log()` method prints output to the console, which is useful for debugging.
  
- **Example:**
  ```javascript
  let score = 100;
  console.log(score);  // Output: 100
  ```
  
- **Breakdown:**
  - **console:** The object that interacts with the terminal or browser console.
  - **log():** A method (function) that prints the value you pass to it.
