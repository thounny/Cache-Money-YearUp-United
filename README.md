This repository was created as a shared resource for students in the **Frontend Development track at Year Up United**.

## Why I Created This Repo

Throughout our journey at **Year Up United**, we come across numerous concepts, tools, and technologies essential for frontend development. Sometimes, having quick access to easy-to-understand resources can make all the difference. I created this repository as a way for us to share knowledge, best practices, and lessons learned.

This repository aims to:

- Provide a central location for learning materials.
- Offer examples and guides that simplify difficult topics.
- Encourage collaboration by allowing everyone to contribute.
- Serve as a study resource for program assignments and projects.
